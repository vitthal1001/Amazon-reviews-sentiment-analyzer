If you are first time reader then I would definitely recommend this book. It is was originally written in Portuguese and later translated in English.The story is about a boy from Andalsuia and his adventures through African desert to find treasure in Pyramids of Egypt. One can easily relate with the story because we all have our own goals and this book will teach you that no matter how many obstacles come in your way you should never give upAs per the quality of book goes, It's not that great, Pages are low quality. But the texts are readable without getting strain in your eyes. So I can say the quality of book is okayI'm giving 4 star because of the low quality of the book.I hope this review will help you in your buying decision."
Amazon.in:Customer reviews: The Alchemist,Reviewed in India on 17 August 2018,i love this book,5.0,"There are too many things one can learn from ‚ÄúThe Alchemist‚Äù. Its all about following your dream and about taking the risk of following your dreams, which is actually so difficult to do and there are very few people in this world who actually do, I mean risk it all, just to follow your heart and your dream. Beauty is, the author is so right in saying that when u decide to follow your dreams the entire universe conspires in your favour which he called as the ‚Äúbeginners luck‚Äù and we all have been witness to this beginners luck at one or other point in our lives.Also, he talks about a stage in our journey towards realizing our dreams, where everything just goes haywire and there is everything working against us and it almost takes us to the brink of abandoning everything and just getting back to what was so familiar and comfortable."
Amazon.in:Customer reviews: The Alchemist,Reviewed in India on 20 October 2017,A Midas touch  !,5.0,"This book is not for you if you are looking for a way to escape reality by immersing into a juicy plot during the week end. This book is about you, me and anyone and everyone .It is about our life, our troubles and tribulations, our goals and the purpose of our existence. To determine our goal ( or Personal Legend as Coelho terms) and to pursue and achieve it is not difficult if we are focused because in the words of Coelho,""..... when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.""The story is that of a shepard boy named, Santiago ,from Andulasia. The boy embarks upon a journey in search of a treasure that he had dreamt of. Each one of us are, infact, Santiago, unable to realise when and where we spilt 'the spoon of oil '. As you go through the book you learn that all is not lost and there is hope.Narrated in a simple lucid manner,the story is interspersed with metaphors ,fables and allegories. Compelling, interesting and full of hope and positivity, The Alchemist is a bedrock of inspiration that instills a strong sense of faith in yourself.Such is the power of this book that you will want to read it again and again. Paulo Coelho has an uncanny knack to soothe your soul and boost your morale. This book, in my opinion, should be read by everyone, young and old, atleast once ."

Amazon.in:Customer reviews: The Alchemist,Reviewed in India on 16 July 2018,Honest Review,4.0,"This is probably the most intresting book I've read so far, the writing so the book is amazing and can be easily understand. If you are first time reader then I would definitely recommend this book. It is was originally written in Portuguese and later translated in English.The story is about a boy from Andalsuia and his adventures through African desert to find treasure in Pyramids of Egypt. One can easily relate with the story because we all have our own goals and this book will teach you that no matter how many obstacles come in your way you should never give upAs per the quality of book goes, It's not that great, Pages are low quality. But the texts are readable without getting strain in your eyes. So I can say the quality of book is okayI'm giving 4 star because of the low quality of the book.I hope this review will help you in your buying decision."

Its all about following your dream and about taking the risk of following your dreams, which is actually so difficult to do and there are very few people in this world who actually do, I mean risk it all, just to follow your heart and your dream. Beauty is, the author is so right in saying that when u decide to follow your dreams the entire universe conspires in your favour which he called as the ‚Äúbeginners luck‚Äù and we all have been witness to this beginners luck at one or other point in our lives.Also, he talks about a stage in our journey towards realizing our dreams, where everything just goes haywire and there is everything working against us and it almost takes us to the brink of abandoning everything and just getting back to what was so familiar and comfortable."
